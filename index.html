            <h2>Breaking: League of Legends Arena Will Be Shutting Down April 5th</h2>
            <p>
                A suprising data leak, further confirmed by The Riot Games California Vice President of Operation Office Caveria Kali, revealed that the 
                once popular League of Legends game mode arena, will be shutting down April 5th, due to "an overall low performace and popularity among dedicated fans".
                When investigated directly by The Deimos Report, Kali had this to say 
            </p>
            "The journey (of arena) as been one we will never forget
                however we are always looking for the next best thing at Riot games and it is clear to us that Arena is no longer hitting the mark with fans. 
                We greatly appreciate the few dedicated members (arena) cultivates, but we have unfortantly concluded that the mode is not really sustainable anymore
                to League of Legends long term health." -Caveria Kali: VP of Operations Office at Riot Games.
            </p>
            <p>
                When asking Kali about League of Legends and Arenas future in modes other then Summoners Rift (the primary and intended gameplay) she had this to say
                "We understand and try our best to accomidate players who want to experince something different then the rift, and will be deploying a new game mode shortly.
                we plan to make a public statement on our official social media April 5th about the discontinued development of arena"
            </p>

            <p>
                We at the Deimos Report are excited to see what Riot Games will bring next, and give our heartfelt good bye to Arena.
